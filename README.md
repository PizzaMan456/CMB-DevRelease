# Circuit Map Builder - DevRelease
This is a dev build that I am releasing for the mean time. It is not an open beta so I will not be implementing the feedback, but I will appreciete any feedback I get. Thanks for everyones patience while I sorted out this program. I really would love to make the time in the future to develop this program properly. 
It is closed source as of now, I will make it open source as promised once I refactor the code first.
# Warning
It does **NOT HAVE A SAVE** feature or a way of exporting the track. If you want to share the track you'd have todfhj.8.0_302 or higher? Not sure it's been a while.
